# IntroMachineLearning-LogisticRegression-LinearPrograming
- Assignment in course Intro to Machine Learning.
- Logistic Regression:
  - Implement Logistic Regression.
  - Preprocess the dataset of spam/ham emails.
  - Fitting the model.
  - Choose hyperparameters.
  - Implement ROC Curve and choose good threshold for dataset.
- Linear Programing:
  - Take from scipy linprog and to adjustment the algorithem to find linear isn't have to comply with all constraints.
